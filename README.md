# Vid2Music
This is our CS5804 Spring 2023 Group Project<br/>
We aimed to build an ML model that recognizes emotions from facial expressions from a video and recommends music accordingly. 
We accomplished this task by building a deep learning (DL) pipeline which has two main components:
1) A computer vision module which takes a short video of the frontal face of a user as input and
uses pre-trained deep learning models for feature extraction to capture facial expressions and translate
them into emotions.
2) A recommendation system which takes emotions as input and generates a music playlist as an
output for the user.
